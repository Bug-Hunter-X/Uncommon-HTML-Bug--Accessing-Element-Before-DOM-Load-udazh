This repository demonstrates a relatively uncommon HTML/JavaScript bug. The bug arises from attempting to access and manipulate an HTML element using JavaScript before the element has been fully loaded into the Document Object Model (DOM). This typically results in a JavaScript error because the element is null.  The solution showcases how to use the `DOMContentLoaded` event to ensure the script executes only after the DOM is fully parsed and ready.
